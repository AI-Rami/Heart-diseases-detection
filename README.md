❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data. It was developed as part of a school project and demonstrates a full pipeline from data analysis to model evaluation.

Overview

- Dataset: heart.csv (clinical patient data)
- Target column: 'target' (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)
- Steps covered:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature scaling and encoding
  - Model training and evaluation

---

Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world heart disease dataset
- Feature standardization using StandardScaler
- Train-test split for performance validation
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics
